    <h1>The tale of Radha and Krishna – A Benchmark of Love</h1>
    <div class="one">
    <p>From mythological to this technological era, Radha Krishna has always been symbolised as a 
        benchmark of love. These two words in our Indian history are never been taken separately. 
        Whenever we talk about Radha, it is impossible for any human being to not to think about Lord Krishna. 
        It definitely strikes our head and compels us to think at least once about the everlasting tale of love.
        They shared an eternal love with each other. Regardless of the fact that they never tied a nuptial knot 
        together, they are worshipped together. These days, modern-day couples admire these pure souls most and 
        make promises to each other to be like them. They are the representation of the purest bond, love, 
        and emotions. It is their purity and serenity only which has made their love and care unforgettable.
